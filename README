Small wrapper around `osascript`.
Logs all use of osascript to `/usr/local/var/log/osascript-audit.log`, because jamf tried to use it for something and that spooked me.

To use:

```sh
go build -o /usr/local/bin/osascript
```

Ensure your `$PATH` sets `/usr/local/bin` before `/usr/bin`.
Anything invoking `osascript` by name, and not by path, will call the wrapper in `/usr/local/bin` instead of the default.
